# Introduction:
Data are from the website http://fueleconomy.gov 
This is a problem in modeling/prediction.
The idea is this:  Fuel efficiency from 2010 and 2011 passenger cars and light trucks is provied.  Using data from 2010, find the best model to predict fuel effiency; fit the model using data from 2010, and evaluate model performance using 2011 data.  

Questions:  
1. Is there evidence of an improvement in fuel efficiency from 2010 to 2011?  
2. What variables are most significant predictors of fuel efficienty?  
3. Suggest ways in which fuel efficienty could be improved in future years.  


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(dplyr)
```

data set: fuel economy from US Gov't website

```{r}
data(FuelEconomy)
library(lattice)

```
### Plot shown in the text:
load the data
FE is fuel economy

```{r}
cars2010 <- cars2010[order(cars2010$EngDispl),]
cars2011 <- cars2011[order(cars2011$EngDispl),]
cars2010a <- cars2010
cars2010a$Year <- "2010 Model Year"
cars2011a <- cars2011
cars2011a$Year <- "2011 Model Year"
plotData <- rbind(cars2010a, cars2011a)
plotTheme <- bookTheme(FALSE)
plotTheme$plot.symbol$col <- rgb(.2, .2, .2, .5)
plotTheme$plot.symbol$cex <- 0.7
trellis.par.set(plotTheme)

xyplot(FE ~ EngDispl|Year, plotData,
xlab = "Engine Displacement",
ylab = "Fuel Efficiency (MPG)",
between = list(x = 1.2))

```


##d differences in mean fuel efficiency 2010 to 2011

$H_O$: no difference between FE in 2010 and 2011
$H_A$: there is a difference in FE for years 2010 and 2011

We'll use t test for this inference


```{r}
t.test(cars2010a$FE, cars2011a$FE)

```

Question #1
No evidence of any improvement/differemce in mean FE between 2010 and 2011






### variables in the data set: to 
```{r}
names(cars2010a)
```

try transmissons = AV, AM6 and AM7

```{r}
testTranny = filter(cars2010a, Transmission %in% c('AV', 'M5','AM6'))
trannyModel = glm(FE ~ Transmission, data = testTranny)
summary(trannyModel)

print(mean(testTranny$FE))

```
### Anova on Transmission Only
```{r}
model9 = glm(FE ~ Transmission,data = cars2010a)

summary (model9)

anova(model9)

```
Transmission AV and M5 have the least negative impact to fuel efficiency


Try adding air asperation method to see what it does


```{r}
levels(cars2010a$ExhaustValvesPerCyl)
trannyvalveModel = glm(FE ~ Transmission + ExhaustValvesPerCyl, data = testTranny)
summary(trannyvalveModel)
```

## ANOVA
```{r}
model8 = glm(FE ~ EngDispl+NumCyl+AirAspirationMethod+VarValveTiming+NumGears+IntakeValvePerCyl+VarValveLift+TransLockup +ExhaustValvesPerCyl+TransCreeperGear,data = cars2010a)

summary (model8)

anova(model8)

```
### 2 Answer

The Front Wheel Drive has a statistical significance to improve FE by 5.67. Engine displacement reduces FE by 4.01 as it increases in size. Number of cylynders increases significance when engine displacement is not a factor. Variable valve timing does have a significant effect to improve FE by 1.65. Trans lockup reduces FE by 1.5 as it increases. Exhaust valves per cylynder becomes significant only when engine displacement and number of cylynders are not a factor; once those are removed the number of exhaust valves improves FE by 8.
```{r}

model6 = glm(FE ~ EngDispl+NumCyl+AirAspirationMethod+TransCreeperGear+DriveDesc,data =cars2010a)

summary(model6)

anova(model6)


```
Its appears that TransCreeperGear is a drag leave it out; drive desc fronyt 2 wheel 
```{r}
pruned2010a = filter(cars2010a, TransCreeperGear==0 & DriveDesc== 'TwoWheelDriveFront' & EngDispl < 3)


model2 = glm(FE ~ EngDispl+NumCyl, data=pruned2010a)

summary(model2)

anova(model2)
```


make a prediction for 2011


```{r}
pred2011 = predict(model2, cars2011a) 
#print(pred2011)
hist(pred2011)
boxplot(pred2011, main= 'data from 2011\nmodelall')

```



## Compare average FE for 2011 cars using model1 to FE for all cars in 2010
```{r}
t.test(cars2011a$FE, pred2011)
```
3. Suggest ways in which fuel efficiency could be improved in future years.

### 3 Answer

Suggested improvements for future years would be to only make front wheeled drive vehicles. also, they smaller the engine displacement they can manufacture while keeping the car able to perform will be the most beneficial improvement. Also variable valve timing does improve efficiency when it is used. Trans lockup should not be used if FE is the only factor that they are looking to improve, it may have other benefits, but it is a detriment to fuel effeciency.
